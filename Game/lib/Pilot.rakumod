Pilot.rakumod -- class implementing a pilot

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides  the attributes necessary to play  I<Ace of Aces>:
the aircraft that the pilot flies, his perspicacity (capability to see
through the  mists of time),  mental stiffness (propensity to  keep on
trodden paths  or capability to leave  them) and the list  of aircraft
and pilots he uses as an inspiration for his flying skills.

There are also  a few decorative attributes, such as  the pilot's name
and identity (simplified name used for access keys and for URLs).
