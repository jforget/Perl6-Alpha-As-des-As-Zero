=head1 ACE OF ACES FOR A SELF-LEARNING MACHINE

=head2 PURPOSE

The programs in this repository are based on the game series
"Ace of Aces", published in the 1980's by Nova Games.

In the F<Preparation> folder, the programs allow the user to compose
a game booklet, after listing the movements allowed to the flying object.

In the F<Jeu> (= "game") folder, the programs apply to the "Ace of Aces"
game the same principles that "Google Alpha Go Zero" applied to Go:
self-learning the tricks of the trade.
